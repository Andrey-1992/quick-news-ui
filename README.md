## Overview

This project was created for the Mod 4 Take Home Challenge. We were given a minimum set of requirements to incorporate into an MVP for this application. The requirements are as follows:

- A list of articles
- A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
- Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort


## Features

- UI that accesses data from [NYT Top Articles API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview) to provide a condensed news-reading experience for the User
- On visiting, the site displays the current date and the top articles from across all categories
- A User can click on an individual article's "Read more" button and get a detailed view of that article, along with a link to the full one
- Users can choose a news category of their choice and have the application load relevant articles
- Error handling for invalid URLs, too many requests, and server errors
- Responsive design for use across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- WAVE and Lighthouse audit compliant
